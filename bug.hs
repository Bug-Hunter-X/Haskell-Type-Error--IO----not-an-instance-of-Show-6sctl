This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function with a type that isn't supported.  The function `mysteryFunction` is defined to work on any type `a` that is an instance of the `Show` typeclass. However, when we try to use it with a function that returns a `IO ()`, it fails because `IO ()` is not an instance of `Show`. The `Show` typeclass is used for displaying values, but `IO ()` represents an action (side effect) and cannot be directly displayed.

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: (Show a) => a -> IO ()
mysteryFunction x = putStrLn $ show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = do
      putStrLn "This is a side effect"
      return ()
  mysteryFunction result
```
