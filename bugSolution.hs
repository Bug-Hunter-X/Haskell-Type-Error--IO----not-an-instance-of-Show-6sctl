The solution involves separating the side effects from the display logic.  We can either modify `mysteryFunction` to handle `IO` actions or redesign the code to avoid passing `IO ()` where a `Show` instance is required.

Here's a solution where the main function handles the side effects and `mysteryFunction` only handles values that are instances of `Show`:

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: (Show a) => a -> IO ()
mysteryFunction x = putStrLn $ show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let value = 10
  mysteryFunction value
  let result = do
      putStrLn "This is a side effect"
      return ()
  result  -- We execute the IO action but don't try to display it
```

Alternatively, we could modify `mysteryFunction` if necessary to handle `IO` actions, but that would typically involve more complex monadic handling depending on the specific requirements.
